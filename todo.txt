rebase
trading peer is null in history
remove bitcoin-qt dependency
use "deposit tx" terminology instead of "fund multisig"
use rpc instead of jni bindings? requires notifications in monero-java
resume listeners on startup (BisqSetup.start() - init multisig?)
finalize protocol (when to remove trade from books, tx ids, no arbitrator till ms?)
deploy seed
trade removed from books immediately or when taker pays fee?
balances: total, locked, reserved?
verify payout txs in dispute
user can review/accept/reject arbitrator payout decision
arbitrator fee?
proper error handling
peer verify fee tx
multisig wallets replaced if exist and trade restarted
multisig wallets named with trade id + trade peer id for concurrent acceptance?
use getNewAddressEntry() to register payout destination
use BigIntegers instead of satoshi conversion?
remove bitcoinj dependency?
manage all funds in account 0 with reserved subaddresses or move failed trade account funds to account 0 (incurs miner fee + 10 block wait time)
refactor State/Phase for CleanupTradeableOnFault
temp node address vs trusting/persisitng into trade model
ui designs
flatten ProcessModel into Trade / other model refactors?
might occasionally need to reimburse taker fee if maker does not enter into multisig
